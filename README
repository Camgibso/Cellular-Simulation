# If an “alive” square has exactly two, three, or four 
living neighbors, then it continues to be “alive” in the 
next time step.

# If a “dead” square has an even number greater than 0 living 
neighbors, then it will be “alive” in the next time step.

# Every other square dies or remains dead, causing it to be 
“dead” in the next time step.
