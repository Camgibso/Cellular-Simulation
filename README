- Read a matrix from the file
    - Req: Entire file path must exist, otherwise error (Complete)
    - Read only O's and .'s else error

- Altar the matrix
    - Rules: 
    1) Any position in the matrix with a period ‘.’ is considered 
        “dead” during the current time step.
    2) Any position in the matrix with a capital ‘O’ is considered 
        “alive” during the current time step.
    3) If an “alive” square has exactly two, three, or four living 
        neighbors, then it continues to be “alive” in the next time step.
    4) If a “dead” square has an even number greater than 0 living 
        neighbors, then it will be “alive” in the next time step.
    5) Every other square dies or remains dead, causing it to be 
        “dead” in the next time step.

- Write a matrix into a file
    - Req: Directory must exist (Complete)

Your solution will accept the starting matrix (Time Step 0) as a file
from the command line and then simulate steps 1 through 100. The final 
matrix (Time Step 100) will then be written to an output file whose name 
and path is dictated by a separate command line argument. These files must 
contain a copy of your matrix with each row of the matrix printed on separate 
lines and no characters in between the columns. Example files are provided as 
part of the project.
