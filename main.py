# If an “alive” square has exactly two, three, or four living neighbors, then it continues to be “alive” in the next time step.

# If a “dead” square has an even number greater than 0 living neighbors, then it will be “alive” in the next time step.

# Every other square dies or remains dead, causing it to be “dead” in the next time step.
